# Social-Media-Content-Analyzer
## Project Link: https://priyansu209.github.io/Social-Media-Content-Analyzer/
## Approach :-
The Social Media Content Analyzer was developed as a client-side web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It leverages PDF.js for text extraction from PDF files and Tesseract.js for OCR on image formats such as PNG, JPEG. The application supports both drag-and-drop and manual file upload, ensuring ease of use.

During processing, a progress indicator is displayed to provide feedback. Extracted text is shown in a formatted container with options to copy, download, or share results. Additional features include content metrics (word and character count), sentiment placeholders, hashtag suggestions, and platform optimization recommendations to help users refine social media posts. All processing occurs in-browser, ensuring privacy and reducing dependency on external servers.

Error handling is implemented to catch invalid or oversized files, while responsive design and dark mode support improve accessibility. The interface is styled using a modern design system for usability and visual appeal.

The project demonstrates practical application of file parsing, OCR, and front-end best practices. Future improvements could include integrating AI APIs for advanced sentiment analysis and engagement prediction.
