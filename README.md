# Social-Media-Content-Analyzer
## Project Link: https://priyansu209.github.io/Social-Media-Content-Analyzer/
## Approach :-
The Social Media Content Analyzer is a client-side web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses PDF.js to extract text from PDF files and Tesseract.js for OCR on image formats such as PNG and JPEG. Users can upload files either by drag-and-drop or through manual selection, making the tool simple and accessible.

While files are being processed, a progress indicator keeps users informed. Once complete, the extracted text is displayed in a clean, formatted container with options to copy, download, or share the results. The application also provides useful content metrics such as word and character counts, along with placeholders for sentiment analysis, hashtag suggestions, and platform-specific optimization tips to help refine social media posts.

All text extraction and processing happen directly in the browser, ensuring full privacy and minimizing reliance on external servers. To improve usability, the application includes error handling for invalid or oversized files, responsive design, and dark mode support for accessibility. The interface follows a modern design system, balancing functionality with visual appeal.

This project highlights the practical use of file parsing, OCR, and front-end development best practices. In the future, the tool could be expanded with AI-powered features such as advanced sentiment analysis and engagement prediction to provide even deeper insights.
